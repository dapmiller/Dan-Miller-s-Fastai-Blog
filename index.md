Hello and welcome to my blog. This was designed as part of a course I am doing at my university. Studying Computer Science and Engineering,  I typically don't have a clue what's going on, but that's the best way to live life. Always new things to learn!

This blog will just be a short collection of some interesting thoughts I've had whilst doing this assignment so please enjoy.
