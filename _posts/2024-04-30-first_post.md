# Official First Post for my Blog

As part of ELEC4630, a course I am taking at the University of Queensland, I have been instructed to start up a blog about my learning experience with fast.ai. This is my first attempt at blogging, hence I have followed the steps provided with https://www.fast.ai/posts/2020-01-16-fast_template.html. 

This has been a great resource to set up the intial blog structure. It features step by step guide setting up the repositry, the homepage and then how to make posts (like this one!). Now I just need to implement the cheeky styling that is mentioned at the end of the document.

Stay tuned for more :)
